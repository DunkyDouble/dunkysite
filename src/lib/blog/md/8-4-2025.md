Most of the existing games from before are now working again! At least 100 of the older games were fixed.

Plenty of games got removed, but also tons of games got added and many are very complex or new games.

The site is still in a BETA state as I have a few more things to add. If some games are broken, make sure to let me know.

This huge update was possible thanks to the likes of many other game site hosts, such as 3kh0, gn-math, genizy, scheng123321, unxa, udbsite, 98corbins, burnedpopcorn, irv77, bubbls, reunbozdo, Irusso, FreeSwfGames, unxw, irv77, GalacticNetwork, and others.
